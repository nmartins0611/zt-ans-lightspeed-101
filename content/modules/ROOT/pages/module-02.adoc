_A guide to using Ansible Lightspeed to generate a playbook that deploys and configures the Cockpit web console on Red Hat Enterprise Linux._

== Introduction and Setup

**Important Note About This Lab**

IBM watsonx Code Assistant models are continuously updated and improved. As a result, some specific task generation challenges in this lab may not work exactly as described due to model updates. This is expected behavior.

**The primary goal of this lab is to help you understand the key features of Ansible Lightspeed, including:**

* **Playbook Generation** - Generating entire playbooks from natural language prompts
* **Task Generation** - Generating individual tasks or multiple tasks at once
* **Training Matches** - Understanding the transparency of AI suggestions
* **Best Practices** - Learning how Lightspeed incorporates Ansible best practices

**If a specific prompt doesn't generate suggestions as expected:**

* Try **playbook generation** instead of task generation (delete the play structure and generate the entire playbook from a prompt)
* Experiment with different prompt variations to see what gives you the best suggestions
* Simplify complex multi-task prompts into separate single-task prompts
* The learning objectives remain the same: understanding how to work with AI-assisted Ansible development
====

In this challenge, you will use Ansible Lightspeed to generate an Ansible Playbook that automates the deployment and configuration of Cockpit, the RHEL web console.

=== Your Mission

Your goal is to use Ansible Lightspeed to generate a playbook that automates the following tasks:

.   Installs `cockpit` using the `redhat.rhel_system_roles` collection.
.   Copies a custom `cockpit.conf` configuration file to the target host.
.   Starts and enables the `cockpit` service.
.   Verifies that the service is available.

The examples used in this lab are available in the link:https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lightspeed-demos[Ansible Lightspeed Demo repository].

== Task 1: Generate Playbook Tasks with Ansible Lightspeed

You will now edit a pre-created playbook file and use natural language prompts to have Ansible Lightspeed generate the necessary tasks.

.   **Open the playbook file in VS Code.**
+
    In the **VS Code** tab, navigate to the file explorer and **open** `playbooks/infra/install_cockpit/demo_install_cockpit.yml`.

.   **Generate the `cockpit` installation task.**
+
    **Uncomment** the first task name by removing the `#` or pressing `CTRL+/`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
# - name: Install cockpit using redhat.rhel_system_roles collection
----
+
    **Place** your cursor at the end of the line and press `ENTER`. Ansible Lightspeed will generate a task suggestion. **Press** `TAB` to accept it.
+
    _Lightspeed Highlight:_ The suggestion correctly uses the `redhat.rhel_system_roles.cockpit` role as specified in the prompt, incorporating best practices like using the Fully Qualified Collection Name (FQCN).

.   **Generate the file copy task.**
+
    **Uncomment** the next task name:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# - name: Copy cockpit.conf.j2 to /etc/cockpit
----
+
    **Place** your cursor at the end of the line, press `ENTER`, and then `TAB` to accept the suggestion.
+
    _Lightspeed Highlight:_ Based on the `.j2` file extension in the prompt, Lightspeed correctly infers that the `ansible.builtin.template` module should be used and sets the correct file permissions.

.   **Generate the multi-task to manage the service.**
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Remember that multi-task prompts have a different structure. They start with a `#`, separate tasks with an ampersand (`&`), and should not be uncommented.
====
+
    Go to the end of the following line, press `ENTER`, and then `TAB` to accept the suggestion:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# Restart and enable service & wait 15 seconds for it to be available
----
+
    _Lightspeed Highlight:_ Lightspeed uses the full playbook context to infer that the service to restart is `cockpit`. It then uses the `&` separator to identify the second task and correctly uses the default Cockpit port (9090) in the `wait_for` module.

.   **Save the playbook** by navigating to **File** → **Save** or by pressing `CTRL+S`.

== Task 2: Review Ansible Lightspeed Training Matches

One of Ansible Lightspeed's key differentiators is providing information on the potential training data used to generate suggestions.

.   **Open the Lightspeed Training Matches view.**
+
    In VS Code, open the View menu by clicking **View** → **Open View...**, search for `Lightspeed`, and select **Lightspeed Training Matches**.

.   **Examine a training match.**
+
    Choose any task description in your playbook and regenerate a suggestion. The Training Matches pane will populate with potential sources. **Click** on any entry to see details including the content source, author, and license.

== Task 3: Run the Playbook

You can now choose to run the completed `demo_install_cockpit.yml` playbook using either the automation controller or `ansible-navigator`.

=== Option 1: Using Automation Controller

.   **Commit and push the playbook.**
+
    In VS Code, **click** the **Source Control** icon. **Click** the **+** icon next to the playbook name to stage the changes, enter a commit message (e.g., `Install Cockpit`), and **click** the **Commit** button. Finally, **click** **Sync Changes** to push the playbook to the repository.

.   **Run the `Deploy monitoring` Job Template.**
+
    Go to the **Ansible Automation Platform** tab. Log in with credentials `admin` / `ansible123!` if prompted. Navigate to **Resources** → **Templates** and **click** the launch icon (🚀) next to the **Deploy monitoring** Job Template.
+
    Wait for the job to complete successfully.

=== Option 2: Using ansible-navigator

.   **Open a terminal in VS Code.**
+
    In the **VS Code** tab, click **Terminal** → **New Terminal**.

.   **Navigate to the correct folder.**
+
[source,bash]
----
cd playbooks/infra/install_cockpit
----

.   **Run the playbook.**
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-navigator run demo_install_cockpit.yml
----
+
Press the `ESC` key to return to the prompt after the playbook completes.

== Task 4: Verify the Cockpit Installation

Finally, verify that the Cockpit web interface is accessible.

.   **Open the Cockpit tab** at the top of the lab window.

.   **Verify the Cockpit UI is accessible.** If the playbook completed successfully, you should see the Cockpit web interface.
