_A guide to using Ansible Lightspeed to generate a playbook that deploys and configures the Cockpit web console on Red Hat Enterprise Linux._

== Introduction and Setup

[IMPORTANT]

**Important Note About This Lab**

IBM watsonx Code Assistant models are continuously updated and improved. As a result, some specific task generation challenges in this lab may not work exactly as described due to model updates. This is expected behavior.

**The primary goal of this lab is to help you understand the key features of Ansible Lightspeed, including:**

* **Playbook Generation** - Generating entire playbooks from natural language prompts
* **Task Generation** - Generating individual tasks or multiple tasks at once
* **Training Matches** - Understanding the transparency of AI suggestions
* **Best Practices** - Learning how Lightspeed incorporates Ansible best practices

**If a specific prompt doesn't generate suggestions as expected:**

* Try **playbook generation** instead of task generation (delete the play structure and generate the entire playbook from a prompt)
* Experiment with different prompt variations to see what gives you the best suggestions
* Simplify complex multi-task prompts into separate single-task prompts
* The learning objectives remain the same: understanding how to work with AI-assisted Ansible development
====

In this challenge, you will use Ansible Lightspeed to generate an Ansible Playbook that automates the deployment and configuration of Cockpit, the RHEL web console.

=== Your Mission

Your goal is to use Ansible Lightspeed to generate a playbook that automates the following tasks:

.   Installs `cockpit` using the `redhat.rhel_system_roles` collection.
.   Copies a custom `cockpit.conf` configuration file to the target host.
.   Starts and enables the `cockpit` service.
.   Verifies that the service is available.

The examples used in this lab are available in the link:https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lightspeed-demos[Ansible Lightspeed Demo repository].

**Need Help?** If you encounter difficulties or want to verify your work, you can reference the solution playbook at `playbooks/infra/install_cockpit/solution_install_cockpit.yml` in the repository.

== Task 1: Generate Playbook Tasks with Ansible Lightspeed

You will now edit a pre-created playbook file and use natural language prompts to have Ansible Lightspeed generate the necessary tasks.

.   **Open the playbook file in VS Code.**
+
    a. Click on the **VS Code** tab at the top of your lab environment.
+
    b. On the left side of VS Code, locate the **Explorer** icon (it looks like two overlapping documents) and click it to show the file explorer.
+
    c. In the file explorer, expand the folders: **playbooks** → **infra** → **install_cockpit**
+
    d. Click on **demo_install_cockpit.yml** to open it in the editor.

.   **Generate the `cockpit` installation task.**
+
    a. In the playbook file, find the line that says:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    #- name: Install cockpit using redhat.rhel_system_roles collection
----
+
    b. **Remove the `#` symbol** at the beginning of the line. You can either:
       * Delete the `#` manually, OR
       * Click anywhere on the line and press `CTRL+/` (Windows/Linux) or `CMD+/` (Mac) to uncomment it
+
    c. **Place your cursor at the very end of the line** (after "collection")
+
    d. **Press `ENTER`** to create a new line
+
    e. Wait a moment - Ansible Lightspeed will show a suggestion in gray text
+
    f. **Press `TAB`** to accept the suggestion
+
    _Lightspeed Highlight:_ The suggestion correctly uses the `redhat.rhel_system_roles.cockpit` role as specified in the prompt, incorporating best practices like using the Fully Qualified Collection Name (FQCN).

.   **Generate the file copy task.**
+
    a. Find the next commented line:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    #- name: Copy cockpit.conf.j2 to /etc/cockpit directory
----
+
    b. **Uncomment the line** by removing the `#` (or press `CTRL+/` / `CMD+/`)
+
    c. **Place your cursor at the end of the line** (after "directory")
+
    d. **Press `ENTER`** to create a new line
+
    e. **Press `TAB`** when Lightspeed shows a suggestion
+
    _Lightspeed Highlight:_ Based on the `.j2` file extension in the prompt, Lightspeed correctly infers that the `ansible.builtin.template` module should be used and sets the correct file permissions.

.   **Generate the multi-task to manage the service.**
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
**Multi-task prompts work differently:** They start with a single `#`, separate multiple tasks with an ampersand (`&`), and should **NOT** be uncommented. Just press ENTER at the end of the comment line.
====
+
    a. Find the line:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    # Restart and enable service & wait 15 seconds for it to be available
----
+
    b. **Do NOT uncomment this line** - leave the `#` symbol in place
+
    c. **Place your cursor at the end of the line** (after "available")
+
    d. **Press `ENTER`** to create a new line
+
    e. **Press `TAB`** when Lightspeed shows suggestions for BOTH tasks
+
    _Lightspeed Highlight:_ Lightspeed uses the full playbook context to infer that the service to restart is `cockpit`. It then uses the `&` separator to identify the second task and correctly uses the default Cockpit port (9090) in the `wait_for` module.

.   **Save the playbook.**
+
    Click **File** → **Save** from the top menu, or press `CTRL+S` (Windows/Linux) or `CMD+S` (Mac).

== Task 2: Review Ansible Lightspeed Training Matches

One of Ansible Lightspeed's key differentiators is providing information on the potential training data used to generate suggestions.

.   **Open the Lightspeed Training Matches view.**
+
    a. At the top of VS Code, click **View** in the menu bar
+
    b. Select **Open View...**
+
    c. In the search box that appears, type `Lightspeed`
+
    d. Click on **Lightspeed Training Matches** from the list

.   **Examine a training match.**
+
    a. In your playbook, click on any task name you generated
+
    b. Delete one line of the generated code and press `ENTER` to regenerate the suggestion
+
    c. Look at the **Lightspeed Training Matches** pane (usually at the bottom of VS Code)
+
    d. You'll see potential training sources. **Click** on any entry to see details including the content source, author, and license information.

== Task 3: Run the Playbook

You can now choose to run the completed `demo_install_cockpit.yml` playbook using either the automation controller or `ansible-navigator`.

=== Option 1: Using Automation Controller

.   **Commit and push the playbook to Git.**
+
    a. On the left side of VS Code, click the **Source Control** icon (it looks like a branch with circles)
+
    b. You should see `demo_install_cockpit.yml` listed under "Changes"
+
    c. Hover over the file name and click the **+** (plus) icon that appears to stage the changes
+
    d. At the top, in the "Message" box, type a commit message like: `Install Cockpit`
+
    e. Click the **Commit** button (checkmark icon)
+
    f. Click the **Sync Changes** button to push your playbook to the Git repository

.   **Run the playbook from Automation Controller.**
+
    a. Click the **Ansible Automation Platform** tab at the top of the lab window
+
    b. If you see a login screen, enter:
       * **Username:** `admin`
       * **Password:** `ansible123!`
+
    c. On the left sidebar, click **Resources** → **Templates**
+
    d. Find the template named **Deploy monitoring**
+
    e. Click the **launch icon** (🚀 rocket ship) on the right side of that row
+
    f. Wait for the job to complete successfully (you'll see a green "Successful" status)

=== Option 2: Using ansible-navigator

.   **Open a terminal in VS Code.**
+
    a. Make sure you're on the **VS Code** tab
+
    b. Look at the top menu bar and click **Terminal** → **New Terminal**
+
    c. A terminal panel will open at the bottom of VS Code

.   **Navigate to the playbook folder.**
+
    In the terminal, type the following command and press `ENTER`:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd playbooks/infra/install_cockpit
----

.   **Run the playbook with ansible-navigator.**
+
    Type the following command and press `ENTER`:
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-navigator run demo_install_cockpit.yml
----
+
    The playbook will run and show you the results. Press the `ESC` key to return to the terminal prompt when it's done.

== Task 4: Verify the Cockpit Installation

Finally, verify that the Cockpit web interface is accessible.

.   **Open the Cockpit web interface.**
+
    At the very top of your lab environment, click the **Cockpit** tab.

.   **Verify Cockpit is running.**
+
    If the playbook completed successfully, you should see the Cockpit web console interface. This confirms that Cockpit was installed, configured, and started correctly!
