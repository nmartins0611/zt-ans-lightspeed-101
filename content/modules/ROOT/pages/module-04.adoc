= OPTIONAL - Terraform and the Certified Collection for Terraform

Several years ago Red Hat released a certified collection for Terraform, in   this exercise you will use some of the components at the Command Line.

👋 Challenge introduction.


== *_OPTIONAL CHALLENGE_*

Estimated time to complete: _30 minutes_

=== OPTIONAL - Terraform and the Red Hat Certified Collection for Terraform, from Ansible
In this challenge you will learn:

* How to install the Red Hat certified collection for Terraform locally (`cloud.terraform`)
* Use `ansible-playbook` command line tool and run an Ansible playbook that will kick off a Terraform project
* About the `Terraform Provider for Ansible`, and the `Terraform Provider for Ansible Automation Platform`

=== Certified Collections

Now that you have  played with Terraform, let's have a look at the Certified Collection from Ansible.
This Red Hat certified collection for Terraform is called `cloud.terraform`.
It gives you a tried and tested method of working with Terraform from Ansible Automation Platform.

Additionally, there is also a *Terraform provider for Ansible* `ansible/ansible`, and a *Terraform Provider for Ansible Automation Platform* `ansible/aap`, for more Terraform centric work.
Both of these Terraform providers are available on the Terraform Registry site.

*USE CASE:* You are a Terraform users and you want to start using Ansible Automation Platform to integrate your Terraform IaC into your larger automation strategy.

For this challenge you will use the Ansible command line `ansible-playbook`, and you will look at the *Red Hat certfied collection for Terraform* `cloud.terraform`, and you will get some exposure on how we can use the collection's modules and components.

NOTE: You can perform the following steps at the TERMINAL, or in Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
In VSCode you can open a terminal prompt.
Choose either the `TERMINAL` tab, or the `VSCODE` tab from the top of the lab screen.
We will walk through the steps using the `TERMINAL` but please feel free to do this in the `VSCODE` tab if you are more comfortable there!

'''

== ☑️ Task 1 - Install the Red Hat certified collection for Terraform (cloud.terraform)

To get access to the Red Hat Certifed collection for Terraform, you will need to install it.
Open the `Terminal` tab from the top of the lab.

From the terminal prompt run the following command to install the `cloud.terraform` collection.
This will pull down the collection and install it on your local machine.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ansible-galaxy collection install cloud.terraform
----

Once installed, we are ready to use the collection.
Please create a playbook called `deploy.yml`.

Be sure you are in the following folder `/home/rhel/lab_exercises/2.Terraform_Ansible`

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cd /home/rhel/lab_exercises/2.Terraform_Ansible
----

Create the `deploy.yml` file and paste in the following text.

[source,yaml,role=execute]
----
---
- name: Infrastructure Deployment
  hosts: localhost

  vars:
    project_dir: /home/rhel/lab_exercises/2.Terraform_Ansible

  tasks:

    - name: Basic deploy of an instance
      cloud.terraform.terraform:
        project_path: '{{ project_dir }}'
        state: present
        force_init: true

    - name: Remove Instance
      cloud.terraform.terraform:
        project_path: '{{ project_dir }}'
        state: absent
        force_init: true
      tags:
        - never
        - remove
----

Once saved, run this playbook.
This will create infrastructure in AWS using the Terraform manifest file provided in the current folder `/home/rhel/lab_exercises/2.Terraform_Ansible`.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ansible-playbook deploy.yml
----

Once this has been deployed you can check it in AWS with the details provided.
Click on the `AWS Console` tab at the top of the lab.
Here you will see your temporary AWS account details needed.

image::https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/awsconsole.png?raw=true[,800]

Launch the AWS console from the `Account ID` launch link Login with the AWS credentials

image::https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/awslogin.png?raw=true[,800]

NOTE: Please see that many resources have been created in AWS as a result of this Terraform project that was triggered by Ansible.
*_You will see AWS infrastructure resources, like VPC, Subnets, Security groups, Route Tables, Internet Gateway, an EC2 instance and more._*

To remove the infrastrucre resources that were recently created by Terraform, you can simply run the Ansible playbook with the `remove` tag.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ansible-playbook deploy.yml --tags remove
----

While still in the AWS console, please observe that the resources have been removed.

In summary, Ansible just performed the following while using the `cloud.terraform` collection that was installed locally

* Ansible launched an Ansible playbook to trigger a Terraform project to `CREATE` the AWS infrastructure resources
* Ansible launched an Ansible playbook to trigger a Terraform project to `REMOVE` the AWS infrastructure resources

*_If you recall in the first challenge we performed similar tasks from the Ansible Automation Platform user interface._*

'''

== ☑️ Task 2 - Terraform Provider for Ansible *(OPTIONAL)*

*_(This is an OPTIONAL task)_*

There is a Terraform Provider for Ansible built by the Red Hat Ansible team.
The provider allows you to specify Ansible host information in the `main.tf`.
It allows you to define an Ansible Inventory in the `main.tf` file, and once the project is initialized and built by Terraform, you can gather Terraform resource information from the state file and push it into the Ansible Inventory.

Open the `Terminal` tab from the top of the lab.

Change to the `/home/rhel/lab_exercises/3.Terraform_Provider` folder

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cd /home/rhel/lab_exercises/3.Terraform_Provider
----

If you have a look at the `main.tf`, you will see that the current `required_providers` block consists just of information about the AWS provider.
Lets add the ansible provider into this block

*_BEFORE_*

[source,terraform]
----
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 6.0"
    }
  }
}
----

Add the Ansible provider details into this block.
This is what that top section of the main.tf file will look like after your edits.
Feel free to use `vi` or `nano` to modify the `main.tf` file.

*_AFTER_*

[source,terraform,role=execute]
----
terraform {
  required_providers {
    ansible = {
      version = "~> 1.3.0"
      source  = "ansible/ansible"
    }
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 6.0"
    }
  }
}
----

In the SSH key resource section you need to add your public key.
To retrieve the public key run this at the terminal prompt:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cat  ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
----

Now you can update the `aws_key_pair` resource with that output

*_BEFORE_*

[source,terraform]
----
# Add key for ssh connection
resource "aws_key_pair"  "my_key"  {
  key_name =  "my_key"
  public_key =  "<your ssh key output>"
}
----

*_AFTER_*

[source,terraform,role=execute]
----
# Add key for ssh connection
resource "aws_key_pair" "my_key" {
  key_name   = "my_key"
  public_key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCSsj...but..with..your..specific..key............................"
}
----

Once you have specified the Ansible provider details and added your SSH key, you need to add the Ansible host inventory details into the `main.tf`.
Add the following section to the end of the `main.tf` file

[source,terraform,role=execute]
----
resource "ansible_host" "my_ec2" {
  name   = aws_instance.my_ec2.public_dns
  groups = ["nginx"]
  variables = {
    ansible_user                 = "ec2-user",
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file = "~/.ssh/id_rsa",
    ansible_python_interpreter   = "/usr/bin/python3",
  }
}
----

`Save` the changes.

Have a look at the `inventory.yml` file and notice the plugin definition

[source,yaml]
----
---
plugin: cloud.terraform.terraform_provider
----

Let's tie it all up with a simple shell script!
Create a `deploy.sh` bash script with the following content:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
#!/bin/sh

set -eux

terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve

ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml nginx.yml

ip=$(ansible-inventory -i inventory.yml --list | jq -r '.nginx.hosts[0]')
curl "http://${ip}" --fail
----

This script combines a number of steps

* `terraform init` and, then `terraform apply` process
* Once the resources have been built the host details are added to the inventory file
* *THEN*, it starts `ansible-playbook` that runs an Ansible playbook called `nginx.yml` to configure the ec2 instance with a webserver, and add it to the Ansible Inventory
* Ansible inventory (via the inventory plugin of the `cloud.terraform` collection) gathers the IP/hostname of the ec2 instance from the Ansible Inventory
* Performs a quick `curl` to test that the webserver is running before exiting

Before running the script don't forget to make it executable by running the following command at the terminal prompt:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
chmod +x deploy.sh
----

Run the shell script:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
 ./deploy.sh
----

Upon successful completion you will see the following as a result of the `curl` test

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
<style>
html { color-scheme: light dark; }
body { width: 35em; margin: 0 auto;
font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
working. Further configuration is required.</p>

<p>For online documentation and support please refer to
<a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx.org</a>.<br/>
Commercial support is available at
<a href="http://nginx.com/">nginx.com</a>.</p>

<p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
</body>
</html>
----

Once the script has finished, check the Ansible inventory:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ansible-inventory -i inventory.yml --graph --vars
----

You should see output similar to the following:

[source,text]
----
@all:
  |--@ungrouped:
  |--@nginx:
  |  |--ec2-###-###-###-###.compute-1.amazonaws.com
  |  |  |--{ansible_python_interpreter = /usr/bin/python3}
  |  |  |--{ansible_ssh_private_key_file = ~/.ssh/id_rsa}
  |  |  |--{ansible_user = ec2-user}
----

You can see that the Ansible inventory (via the inventory plugin of the `cloud.terraform` collection) has grabbed the instance details we specified in our `main.tf`.
Using the Terraform Provider for Ansible the Ansible inventory was updated with the resources created by Terraform.

Clean up by issuing a `terraform destroy` command:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
terraform destroy
----

Whem prompted to `Enter a value:` please enter `yes`

Once that is done let's check the inventory again:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ansible-inventory -i inventory.yml --graph --vars
----

You will no longer see the host(s) details:

[source,text]
----
@all:
    |--@ungrouped:
----

You can now take off the Terraform hat, and put on your Red Hat as we move to the next section and work with Ansible Automation Platform.

== ☑️ Task 3 - The Terraform Provider for Ansible Automation Platform

The updated *Terraform Provider for Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)* allows users to send host information from Terraform into Ansible Automation Platform.

Open the `Terminal` tab from the top of the lab.

Change to the `/home/rhel/lab_exercises/4.Terraform_AAP_Provider` folder

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cd /home/rhel/lab_exercises/4.Terraform_AAP_Provider
----

You have a `main.tf` file available for use

Edit the `main.tf` and create an instance that we can send to Ansible Automation Platform.

To do this you use the Terraform Provider for Ansible Automation Platform.
The provider is available globally via Hashicorp's provider registry.

You need to modify the `main.tf` file.
Please UNCOMMENT the provider in the `required_provider` block.

Modify the `main.tf` file.

*_SIMPLY UNCOMMENT THE SECTION_*

[source,terraform,role=execute]
----
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "6.2.0"
    }
    aap = {
      source = "ansible/aap"
    }
  }
}
----

You need to configure the `provider` block so you can send the relevant host information to the Ansible Automationm Platform.

*_SIMPLY UNCOMMENT THE SECTION_*

[source,terraform,role=execute]
----
provider "aap" {
  host     = "https://control"
  username = "admin"
  password = "ansible123!"
  insecure_skip_verify = true
}
----

Next, add the `resource` block into the manifest which is what we will push to the Ansible Automationm Platform.

*_SIMPLY UNCOMMENT THE SECTION_* at the very bottom of the file.

[source,terraform,role=execute]
----
resource "aap_host" "tf-instance-aap-provider" {
  inventory_id = 2
  name = "aws_instance_tf"
  description = "An EC2 instance created by Terraform"
  variables = jsonencode(aws_instance.tf-instance-aap-provider)
}
----

Save the `main.tf` file.

Now, please ``init``ialize the Terraform project, then `plan`, and lastly `apply`.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
terraform init
----

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
terraform plan -out myInstanceForAAP
----

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
terraform apply myInstanceForAAP
----

Once successful, your instance will have been created in AWS.
However, you would also like to verify that the Terraform Provider for Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) did in fact inject the instance details into the Ansible Automation Platform Terraform Inventory.
Please remember, Terraform created the ec2 instance, and using the Terraform Provider for Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) the ec2 instance was injected into the Ansible Automation Platform Inventory.

Click on the `Ansible Automation Platform` tab at the top of lab.

Log in using the following *Login Credentials:*

* `User:  admin`  
* `Password:  ansible123!`

Expand the `Automation Execution` menu on the left.
`Automation Execution` -> `Infrastructure` -> `Inventories`.

Select the `Terraform Inventory`, and then click on the `Hosts` menu.

You will see a host called: `aws_instance_tf`
