_A guide to using Ansible Lightspeed to generate a playbook that provisions a virtual machine in Microsoft Azure._

== Introduction and Setup

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Important Note About This Lab**

IBM watsonx Code Assistant models are continuously updated and improved. As a result, some specific task generation challenges in this lab may not work exactly as described due to model updates. This is expected behavior.

**The primary goal of this lab is to help you understand the key features of Ansible Lightspeed, including:**

* **Playbook Generation** - Generating entire playbooks from natural language prompts
* **Task Generation** - Generating individual tasks or multiple tasks at once
* **Training Matches** - Understanding the transparency of AI suggestions
* **Best Practices** - Learning how Lightspeed incorporates Ansible best practices

**If a specific prompt doesn't generate suggestions as expected:**

* Try **playbook generation** instead of task generation (click the Ansible icon → **Generate a playbook** button, enter your prompt, review the outline, and click Continue)
* Experiment with different prompt variations to see what gives you the best suggestions
* Simplify complex multi-task prompts into separate single-task prompts
* The learning objectives remain the same: understanding how to work with AI-assisted Ansible development
====

In this challenge, you will use Ansible Lightspeed to generate an Ansible Playbook that automates the provisioning of a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine.

=== Your Mission

Your goal is to use Ansible Lightspeed to generate a playbook that automates the following task:

.   Provision a VM called `vm-lightspeed` in the demo Azure account provided by the lab.

The examples used in this lab are available in the link:https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lightspeed-demos[Ansible Lightspeed Demo repository].

[NOTE]
====
**Azure Credentials:** This lab uses a temporary Azure account. You'll find the credentials in the **AWS/Azure** tab at the top of your lab environment when you need them in Task 4.

**Need Help?** If you encounter difficulties or want to verify your work, you can reference the solution playbook at `playbooks/cloud/azure/solution_provision_azure_vm.yml` in the repository.

== Task 1: Generate Playbook Tasks with Ansible Lightspeed

You will now edit a pre-created playbook file and use a natural language prompt to have Ansible Lightspeed generate the necessary task.

.   **Open the playbook file in VS Code.**
+
    a. Click on the **VS Code** tab at the top of your lab environment
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
**Work in a new browser tab:** For the best experience with Ansible Lightspeed features, **click the VS Code tab to open it in a new browser tab** rather than using the inline embedded window.
====
+
    b. On the left side of VS Code, click the **Explorer** icon (two overlapping documents) to show the file explorer
+
    c. In the file explorer, expand these folders: **playbooks** → **cloud** → **azure**
+
    d. Click on **demo_provision_azure_vm.yml** to open it in the editor

.   **Generate the VM provisioning task.**
+
    a. In the playbook file, find the line:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    #- name: Create a VM called vm-lightspeed using vm_config var
----
+
    b. **Uncomment the line** by removing the `#` (or press `CTRL+/` for Windows/Linux or `CMD+/` for Mac)
+
    c. **Place your cursor at the end of the line** (after "var")
+
    d. **Press `ENTER`** to create a new line
+
    e. Wait a moment - Ansible Lightspeed will show a suggestion in gray text
+
    f. **Press `TAB`** to accept the suggestion
+
    _Lightspeed Highlight:_ Lightspeed correctly uses the `azure.azcollection.azure_rm_virtualmachine` module to generate a task that creates an Azure virtual machine. The suggestion also correctly uses the `vm_config` variable from the playbook's `vars` section.

.   **Save the playbook.**
+
    Click **File** → **Save** from the top menu, or press `CTRL+S` (Windows/Linux) or `CMD+S` (Mac).

== Task 2: Review Ansible Lightspeed Training Matches

One of Ansible Lightspeed's key differentiators is providing information on the potential training data used to generate suggestions.

.   **Open the Lightspeed Training Matches view.**
+
    a. At the top of VS Code, click **View** in the menu bar
+
    b. Select **Open View...**
+
    c. In the search box that appears, type `Lightspeed`
+
    d. Click on **Lightspeed Training Matches** from the list

.   **Examine a training match.**
+
    a. In your playbook, click on the task name you generated
+
    b. Delete one line of the generated code and press `ENTER` to regenerate the suggestion
+
    c. Look at the **Lightspeed Training Matches** pane (usually at the bottom of VS Code)
+
    d. You'll see potential training sources. **Click** on any entry to see details including the content source, author, and license information.

== Task 3: Run the Playbook

You can now choose to run the completed playbook using either the automation controller or `ansible-navigator`.

=== Option 1: Using Automation Controller

.   **Commit and push the playbook to Git.**
+
    a. On the left side of VS Code, click the **Source Control** icon (it looks like a branch with circles)
+
    b. You should see `demo_provision_azure_vm.yml` listed under "Changes"
+
    c. Hover over the file name and click the **+** (plus) icon that appears to stage the changes
+
    d. At the top, in the "Message" box, type a commit message like: `Provision Azure VM`
+
    e. Click the **Commit** button (checkmark icon)
+
    f. Click the **Sync Changes** button to push your playbook to the Git repository

.   **Run the playbook from Automation Controller.**
+
    a. Click the **Ansible Automation Platform** tab at the top of the lab window
+
    b. If you see a login screen, enter:
       * **Username:** `admin`
       * **Password:** `ansible123!`
+
    c. On the left sidebar, click **Resources** → **Templates**
+
    d. Find the template named **Provision Azure VM**
+
    e. Click the **launch icon** (🚀 rocket ship) on the right side of that row
+
    f. Wait for the job to complete successfully (you'll see a green "Successful" status)

=== Option 2: Using ansible-navigator

.   **Open a terminal in VS Code.**
+
    a. Make sure you're on the **VS Code** tab
+
    b. Look at the top menu bar and click **Terminal** → **New Terminal**
+
    c. A terminal panel will open at the bottom of VS Code

.   **Navigate to the playbook folder.**
+
    In the terminal, type the following command and press `ENTER`:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd playbooks/cloud/azure
----

.   **Run the playbook with ansible-navigator.**
+
    Type the following command and press `ENTER`:
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-navigator run demo_provision_azure_vm.yml
----
+
    The playbook will run and show you the results. Press the `ESC` key to return to the terminal prompt when it's done.

== Task 4: Verify the VM Provisioning

Finally, verify that the new virtual machine is running in the Azure Portal.

.   **Get your Azure credentials and access the portal.**
+
    a. At the very top of your lab environment, click the **AWS/Azure** tab
+
    b. Scroll down to the **Azure** credentials section
+
    c. You'll see Azure account credentials displayed (Subscription ID, Email, Password, and Portal URL)
+
    d. Click the **Azure Portal URL** link (or copy it to a new browser tab)

.   **Log in to the Azure Portal.**
+
    a. Go back to the **AWS/Azure** tab to copy the credentials
+
    b. Copy the **Email** and **Password** shown in the Azure section
+
    c. Paste them into the Azure login page
+
    d. Click **Sign In**
+
    e. If prompted with additional security questions, click **Skip for now** or **Ask later**

.   **View your Azure VM.**
+
    a. In the Azure Portal, look for the search bar at the top
+
    b. Type `Virtual machines` and click on **Virtual machines** from the results
+
    c. You should see your new VM named **vm-lightspeed** in the list
+
    d. The status should show as "Running"
+
    e. This confirms that your Ansible playbook successfully created the Azure VM!
