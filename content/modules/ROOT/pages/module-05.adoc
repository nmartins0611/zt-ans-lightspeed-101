_A guide to using Ansible Lightspeed to generate a playbook that provisions a virtual machine in Microsoft Azure._

---

== Introduction and Setup

In this challenge, you will use Ansible Lightspeed to generate an Ansible Playbook that automates the provisioning of a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine.

=== Your Mission

Your goal is to use Ansible Lightspeed to generate a playbook that automates the following task:

.   Provision a VM called `vm-lightspeed` in the demo Azure account provided by the lab.

The examples used in this lab are available in the link:https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lightspeed-demos[Ansible Lightspeed Demo repository].

The login credentials for all services in this lab are:

=== Copy and Paste Instructions for the RHEL Workstation

The lab uses a VNC browser instance to access the RHEL workstation. Some browsers, like Firefox and Safari, do not support direct copy and paste. The **Chrome** browser is recommended.

If you are not using Chrome, you can use the **VNC Clipboard utility** to copy and paste between your local machine and the lab instance.

.   **Open the VNC Clipboard utility** on the `RHEL` tab by pressing:
    * `CTRL`+`ALT`+`SHIFT` on Windows or Linux.
    * `CTRL`+`OPTION`+`SHIFT` on Mac.
.   **Use the clipboard text area** as an interface between your local and remote clipboards.

.   **Close the utility** by pressing the same key combination again.

== Task 1: Generate Playbook Tasks with Ansible Lightspeed

You will now edit a pre-created playbook file and use a natural language prompt to have Ansible Lightspeed generate the necessary task.

.   **Open the playbook file in VS Code.**
+
    In the `RHEL` tab, open Visual Studio Code. In the VS Code sidebar, navigate to `playbooks/cloud/azure/` and **open** the `demo_provision_azure_vm.yml` file.
+

.   **Generate the VM provisioning task.**
+
    **Uncomment** the task name by removing the `#` or pressing `CTRL+/`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
# - name: Create a VM called vm-lightspeed using vm_config var
----
+
    **Place** your cursor at the end of the line and press `ENTER`. Ansible Lightspeed will generate a task suggestion. **Press** `TAB` to accept it.
+
    _Lightspeed Highlight:_ Lightspeed correctly uses the `azure.azcollection.azure_rm_virtualmachine` module to generate a task that creates an Azure virtual machine. The suggestion also correctly uses the `vm_config` variable from the playbook's `vars` section.

.   **Save the playbook** by navigating to **File** â†’ **Save** or by pressing `CTRL+S`.

== Task 2: Review Ansible Lightspeed Training Matches

One of Ansible Lightspeed's key differentiators is providing information on the potential training data used to generate suggestions.

.   **Open the Lightspeed Training Matches view.**
+
    In VS Code, open the View menu by clicking **View** â†’ **Open View...**.
+

+
    Search for `Lightspeed` and select **Lightspeed Training Matches**.
+

.   **Examine a training match.**
+
    Regenerate the suggestion for the task in your playbook. The Training Matches pane will populate with potential sources. **Click** on any entry to see details including the content source, author, and license.
+

== Task 3: Run the Playbook

You can now choose to run the completed playbook using either the automation controller or `ansible-navigator`.

=== Option 1: Using Automation Controller

.   **Commit and push the playbook.**
+
    In VS Code, **click** the **Source Control** icon. **Click** the **+** icon next to the playbook name to stage the changes, enter a commit message (e.g., `Provision Azure VM`), and **click** the **Commit** button. Finally, **click** **Sync Changes** to push the playbook to the repository.
+

.   **Run the Job Template.**
+
    Go to the **Controller** tab. Navigate to **Templates** and **click** the launch icon (ðŸš€) next to the **Provision Azure VM** Job Template.
+

+
    Wait for the job to complete successfully.

=== Option 2: Using ansible-navigator

.   **Open a terminal in VS Code.**
+
    Click **Terminal** â†’ **New Terminal**.
+

.   **Navigate to the correct folder.**
+
[source,bash]
----
cd playbooks/cloud/azure
----

.   **Run the playbook.**
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-navigator run demo_provision_azure_vm.yml
----
+
image::../assets/demo_provision_azure_vm-success-navigator.png[Successful run in ansible-navigator, opts="border"]
+
Press the `ESC` key to return to the prompt.

== Task 4: Verify the VM Provisioning

Finally, verify that the new virtual machine is running in the Azure Portal.

.   **Navigate to the Azure Portal.**
+
    Open the **AWS/Azure Credentials** tab and find the Azure credential box. **Click** on the **Subscription ID** link.
+
image:../assets/azure_account.png[Azure account credentials tab, opts="border"]

.   **Log in to Azure.**
+
    **Copy** the Email and password from the credentials tab to log in to the Azure portal.

.   **Check the Virtual Machines.**
+
    **Click** on **Virtual machines**. You should see the new VM, `vm-lightspeed`, that was created by your playbook.
