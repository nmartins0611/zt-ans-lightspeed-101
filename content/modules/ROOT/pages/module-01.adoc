== Introduction and Lab Setup

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Important Note About This Lab**

IBM watsonx Code Assistant models are continuously updated and improved. As a result, some specific task generation challenges in this lab may not work exactly as described due to model updates. This is expected behavior.

**The primary goal of this lab is to help you understand the key features of Ansible Lightspeed, including:**

* **Playbook Generation** - Generating entire playbooks from natural language prompts
* **Task Generation** - Generating individual tasks or multiple tasks at once
* **Training Matches** - Understanding the transparency of AI suggestions
* **Best Practices** - Learning how Lightspeed incorporates Ansible best practices

**If a specific prompt doesn't generate suggestions as expected:**

* Try **playbook generation** instead of task generation (delete the play structure and generate the entire playbook from a prompt)
* Experiment with different prompt variations to see what gives you the best suggestions
* Simplify complex multi-task prompts into separate single-task prompts
* The learning objectives remain the same: understanding how to work with AI-assisted Ansible development
====

In this lab, you will configure Ansible Lightspeed in Visual Studio Code. You will sign up for the Ansible Lightspeed trial service using your own Red Hat account.

The examples used in this lab are available in the link:https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lightspeed-demos[Ansible Lightspeed Demo repository].

Your lab environment provides access to multiple services via the tabs at the top:

* **VS Code** - Visual Studio Code development environment with Ansible extension pre-installed
* **Controller** - Ansible Automation Platform controller for running automation jobs
* **Monitoring** - Cockpit web console for system monitoring (after setup in Module 2)
* **PGAdmin** - PostgreSQL administration interface (after setup in Module 3)

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Lab Credentials**

Different services in this lab use different credentials:

* **Automation Controller:** `admin` / `ansible123!`
* **Gitea (Git Repository):** `gitea` / `gitea`
* **VS Code & RHEL System:** Access via browser tabs (no login required)

== Task 1: Sign Up for Ansible Lightspeed Trial

Before using Ansible Lightspeed, you need to sign up for a trial subscription. This requires creating a Red Hat account and subscribing to both Ansible Automation Platform and Ansible Lightspeed trials.

[IMPORTANT]
====
**If you have previously completed this lab:**

* **Within 60-day trial window:** If you completed this lab within the last 60 days, your trial is still active. Use the same Red Hat account and skip to Task 2.

* **After 60-day trial window:** If your trial has expired, you will need to create a **new Red Hat account using a different email address** to access new AAP and Lightspeed trials. Each account can only access the trial once.

* **If you have an AAP subscription:** If your email is already attached to a paid AAP subscription, you can still access the Ansible Lightspeed trial with that account.

* **No available email addresses:** Unfortunately, there is no workaround if you do not have access to a new email address. Each Red Hat account can only activate the trial one time.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you already have a Red Hat account with active Ansible Lightspeed trial access, you can skip to Task 2.
====

=== Step 1: Create a Red Hat Account

.   **Visit the Red Hat account creation page** at link:https://www.redhat.com/wapps/ugc/register.html[access.redhat.com]

.   **Complete the registration form** with your information and verify your email address.

=== Step 2: Subscribe to Ansible Automation Platform Trial

.   **Visit the Ansible Automation Platform trial page** at link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible/trial[https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible/trial]

.   **Log in** with your newly created Red Hat account credentials.

.   **Complete the trial signup** process for Ansible Automation Platform.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must have an active Ansible Automation Platform trial subscription before you can access the Ansible Lightspeed trial.
====

=== Step 3: Enable Ansible Lightspeed Trial

You will enable the Ansible Lightspeed trial directly from VS Code as part of the connection process in Task 2.

---

== Task 2: Enable and Connect Ansible Lightspeed in VS Code

Now you will enable Ansible Lightspeed in VS Code and connect it to the trial service.

=== Step 1: Open VS Code and Enable Lightspeed Settings

.   **Open the VS Code tab** at the top of your lab environment.

.   **Navigate to the Ansible extension settings:**
    * Click the **Extensions** icon on the left sidebar
    * Find the **Ansible** extension
    * Click the gear icon (⚙️)
    * Select **Extension Settings**

.   **Enable Lightspeed features:**
    * Click the **Workspace** tab
    * Type `lightspeed` in the search bar to filter settings
    * Check both boxes:
      ** Enable Ansible Lightspeed
      ** Enable Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant inline suggestions

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please ensure you configure these settings in the VS Code **Workspace** tab, not the User tab.
====

=== Step 2: Connect to Ansible Lightspeed Service

.   **Click the Ansible extension icon** on the left sidebar in VS Code.

.   **Click the Connect button** in the Ansible Lightspeed section.

.   **Follow the authentication prompts:**
    * VS Code will show pop-ups guiding you through authentication
    * Click **Allow** when prompted to open the authentication page
    * Click **Open** to launch your browser

.   **Log in with your Red Hat account:**
    * A browser window will open to the Red Hat login page
    * Enter your Red Hat account credentials (the account you created in Task 1)
    * Click **Log In**

.   **Authorize VS Code to access Ansible Lightspeed:**
    * After logging in, you'll see an authorization page
    * Click **Authorize** to grant VS Code access

.   **Complete the authentication redirect:**
    * The browser will redirect back to VS Code
    * Click **Open** in the VS Code prompt to complete the connection
    * You should now see `Logged in as <your-email>` in the Ansible extension sidebar

.   **Start the Ansible Lightspeed trial:**
    * In the Ansible extension sidebar (left side), look for the **Start Trial** button in the Ansible Lightspeed section
    * Click the **Start Trial** button
    * A browser window will open with the Ansible Lightspeed trial terms and conditions
    * **Read and accept the terms and conditions**
    * After accepting, the browser will confirm your trial is activated

.   **Refresh and verify the trial is enabled:**
    * Return to VS Code
    * In the Ansible Lightspeed section of the Ansible extension sidebar, click the **refresh icon** (circular arrow)
    * You should now see that your Ansible Lightspeed trial is enabled and active
    * A confirmation notification may appear in the bottom right corner

[IMPORTANT]
====
**The Ansible Lightspeed trial is NOT automatically activated after AAP trial signup.** You must explicitly click **Start Trial** in VS Code and accept the terms and conditions for the trial to become active.
====

[TIP]
====
If you receive a timeout warning during authentication, simply click **Connect** in the Ansible extension again and repeat the authorization steps.
====

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

**Issue: "I'm logged in but don't see the Start Trial button"**

* Solution: Make sure you have completed the AAP trial signup first. The Start Trial button only appears if you have an active AAP trial subscription. Try clicking the refresh icon in the Ansible Lightspeed section.

**Issue: "I clicked Start Trial but my trial still shows as not enabled"**

* Solution: After accepting the terms and conditions in the browser, return to VS Code and click the **refresh icon** (circular arrow) in the Ansible Lightspeed section of the Ansible extension sidebar.

**Issue: "I don't see the option to enable Ansible Lightspeed trial"**

* Solution: Ensure you have completed the Ansible Automation Platform trial signup first. The Lightspeed trial requires an active AAP trial subscription.

**Issue: "Connection times out during authentication"**

* Solution: Click **Connect** in the Ansible extension again and repeat the authorization steps. Make sure pop-ups are not blocked in your browser.

**Issue: "I already have a Red Hat account but no AAP trial"**

* Solution: Visit link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible/trial[the AAP trial page] and sign up using your existing Red Hat account.

**Issue: "My 60-day trial has expired and I don't have another email address"**

* Solution: Unfortunately, there is no workaround. Each Red Hat account can only activate the trial one time. You would need a different email address to create a new account.
